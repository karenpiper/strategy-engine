## 2026-04-04: Investigate API — unwrap { item } wrapper from Panel

**The bug:** `Panel.tsx` sends `{ item: ScratchItem }` as the POST body to `/api/investigate`. The route was destructuring `{ text, sectionLabel, note, contexts }` directly from the body — all undefined, causing Claude to receive "undefined" as the quote.

**The fix:** In the investigate route, unwrap before destructuring:
```typescript
const body = await request.json()
const src = body.item ?? body  // support both { item } and flat { text, ... }
const { text, sectionLabel, note, contexts } = src
```

**How to apply:** Whenever writing an `/api/investigate` route, always unwrap `body.item ?? body` before extracting fields. The Panel will always send the full `ScratchItem` as `{ item }`.

## 2026-04-04: Encode all project session changes into the plugin

**The rule:** Any change made during a client project session — new patterns, new page types, nav structure updates, API variations, workflow decisions — must be encoded into the relevant plugin skill(s) before the session ends. Do this automatically unless Karen explicitly says not to.

**Why:** The plugin is the long-term memory. If a pattern is only in the project repo, it gets lost. If it's in the plugin, it carries forward to every future project.

**How to apply:** At the end of any session where new patterns were established (new page type, nav change, data model, API pattern, research structure, etc.), identify which skill(s) are affected and update them. If it's a new enough pattern that it doesn't fit an existing skill, note it in the feedback log and flag it to Karen.

## 2026-03-18: Skipped Voice DNA + Stop-Slop quality gate on slide copy

**What happened:** Wrote the strategy doc and scored it (Phase 4), but treated the score as a rubber stamp instead of doing a real line-by-line audit. Then wrote 28 slides of slide-ready copy and presented it without running either quality layer. the user caught it.

**What was wrong (examples from the slide copy):**

| Slide | Problem | Rule violated |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Slide 4 | "operational advantage" | Voice DNA: consultant-speak, dead language |
| Slide 24 | "every campaign, every conversation, every market shift" | Stop-Slop: triple-repeat cadence is a classic AI tell |
| Slide 6 | "Research without deployment creates... Advisor tools without validated research creates..." | Stop-Slop: over-symmetric parallel construction reads as generated |
| Slide 6 | "creates" (plural subject) | Grammar: should be "create" |
| Slide 22 | "Everything we do next compounds" | Stop-Slop: vague declarative that sounds smart but says nothing |
| Slide 3 | "shared language" | Voice DNA: cliche-adjacent, vague |
| Slide 16 | "A beautifully designed tool that sits in a folder is worthless" | Stop-Slop: pull-quote trying too hard for a slide |
| Slide 24 | "A GTM engine where audience intelligence gets sharper..." | Stop-Slop: narrator-from-distance voice, reads like a brochure |
| Slide 2 | Symmetrically stacked questions | Stop-Slop: too-tidy setup, feels constructed |

**What the fixes looked like:**

Slide 4 before: "How do we turn strategic understanding into operational advantage?"
Slide 4 after: "How do we turn what we know about these audiences into something UBS teams can act on?"

Slide 16 before: "We won't design the kit in a vacuum. A beautifully designed tool that sits in a folder is worthless."
Slide 16 after: "We won't design the kit without talking to the people who'll use it. The format has to survive contact with an FA's actual Tuesday."

Slide 22 before: "Everything we do next compounds."
Slide 22 after: "Every interview, validated trigger, and verbatim quote we collect feeds the system that comes after this."

Slide 24 before: "A GTM engine where audience intelligence gets sharper with every campaign, every conversation, every market shift."
Slide 24 after: "Audience intelligence that gets sharper with use. Where the next campaign starts smarter than the last one ended."

**The rule:** Both quality layers (Voice DNA + Stop-Slop) must be run line-by-line on every piece of prose BEFORE presenting to the user. The Phase 4 quality gate in the skill is mandatory, not decorative. This applies to strategy docs AND slide copy. No exceptions.

## 2026-03-20: Statement and belief slides had too much body copy

**What happened:** Slides 02 (The Opportunity, red bg) and 03 (The Belief, white bg) each had 3+ sentences of body copy beneath the headline. the user flagged them as too dense for the slide type. These are statement slides where the headline carries the argument. The body should support, not repeat or expand.

**The rule:** For statement slides (red bg, dark bg) and belief slides (white bg with a single declarative headline): **max 2 sentences of body copy.** The headline does the work. The body adds one layer of context or evidence. If you're writing a third sentence, the slide is doing too much. Move the extra content to the next slide or cut it.

**How to apply:** Before writing body copy for any L1 (title), L2 (red statement), or belief/declaration slide, ask: can the headline stand alone? If yes, the body is optional. If no, write 1-2 sentences max. Three sentences means the slide needs restructuring.
