# Strategy Engine

A strategy engine for the full range of strategic work: brand positioning, creative briefs, product vision, GTM narratives, adversarial pressure testing, and multi-agent debate. Built to self-improve over time.

## Command Workflow

All commands use the `/strategy:` namespace prefix.

```
0. BOOTSTRAP   /strategy:using-strategy  → Control plane (auto-loaded)
1. ENTRY       /strategy:go              → Routes to right mode
2. NARRATIVE   /strategy:narrative       → Strategy docs → slide copy
3. BRIEF       /strategy:brief           → Creative briefs
4. PRODUCT     /strategy:product         → Product specs, vision docs
5. TEST        /strategy:pressure-test   → Single-agent adversarial critique
6. DEBATE      /strategy:courtroom       → Multi-agent debate engine
7. DISTILL     /strategy:distill          → Compress copy, merge slides, tighten
8. INSIGHT     /strategy:insight-distill  → Research → insights, tensions, way in
9. REVIEW      /strategy:narrative-review → Score narrative before stakeholders
10. RESEARCH   /strategy:research         → Deep desk research, verified sources
11. ECOSYSTEMS /strategy:ecosystems       → Map, audit, gap analysis, persona crawl
```

## Key Principles

- **Lead agent orchestrates, Julian decides.** The engine routes, delegates, and quality-checks. Julian approves architectures, picks concepts, and gives final sign-off.
- **Quality gates are mandatory, not decorative.** Voice DNA + Stop-Slop run line-by-line on every piece of prose before it reaches Julian. The Phase 4 quality gate scores everything. Below 35/50 gets revised internally.
- **Feedback log outranks everything.** Julian's manual corrections are binding. They override automated improvements, default rules, and the engine's own judgment.
- **Observation compounds.** Every run logs structured data. Over time, the system learns which modes underperform and where.
- **Strategy makes choices.** If output could be endorsed by every brand in the category, it fails. Name what you're choosing NOT to do.
