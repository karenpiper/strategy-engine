description: |
  Score a strategic narrative against the brief, distilled insights, and the user's quality bar.
  Catches drift, missing requirements, unsupported claims, and weak story structure before
  the narrative goes to stakeholders.
  Use for "review the narrative," "is this ready for my boss," "check this against the brief,"
  or before any stakeholder socialization.

# /strategy:narrative-review

Quality gate for strategic narratives before they go to stakeholders. Scores on 7 dimensions, flags critical issues, and protects what's working.

## When to Use

- Before the user socializes a strategic narrative with his boss or CEO
- After `/strategy:narrative` produces output and the user has iterated on it
- Before building a deck from a narrative (catches problems cheaper in prose than in slides)
- When the user asks "is this ready?"

## Process

### Step 1: Load Context

Read in this order:
1. The original brief (the north star)
2. The distilled strategic platform (insights, tensions, way in)
3. The narrative format reference (the user's quality bar, e.g., Bumble case study)
4. The narrative being reviewed

### Step 2: Spawn the Narrative Reviewer Agent

Use the `strategy-engine:review:narrative-reviewer` agent. The agent scores on 7 dimensions and returns a structured review.

### Step 3: Synthesize

If the agent returns PASS (50+/70): present the review to the user with a recommendation to proceed.
If REVISE (35-49): present critical issues and suggest specific fixes before resending.
If FAIL (<35): flag that the narrative needs significant rework. Identify the weakest dimensions.

### Step 4: Voice Check (Mandatory, Separate Pass)

Run the full narrative through Voice DNA + Stop-Slop rules independently. This is a line-by-line scan, not a vibe check. Any banned phrase is flagged with exact location.

### Step 5: Brief Alignment Check (Mandatory, Separate Pass)

Walk through the brief section by section and check:
- Does the narrative address this requirement?
- If yes, where? (cite the slide/section)
- If no, flag it as missing.

Output a brief alignment matrix:

```markdown
| Brief Section | Addressed? | Where in Narrative | Notes |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Brand positioning | Yes/No | Slide X | |
| Visual identity direction | Yes/No | Slide X | |
| Brand architecture | Yes/No | Slide X | |
| ...etc | | | |
```

### Step 6: Present Review

Give User:
1. The 7-dimension score table
2. Critical issues (must fix)
3. Brief alignment matrix
4. Voice check results
5. What's working (don't touch)

the user decides what to fix and what to override.

## Integration

### narrative-review → narrative (revision)
After the user addresses the critical issues, re-run the review to verify fixes landed.

### narrative-review → courtroom (optional)
If the Insight Quality or Strategic Courage scores are low, suggest running the narrative's core argument through `/strategy:courtroom` before revising.

### narrative-review → paper-slides (gate)
The narrative should PASS review before going into slide production. Building slides from a weak narrative wastes time.

## Observation

Log the run per `rules/observation.md`. Track: total score, which dimensions were weakest, how many critical issues, whether the user agreed with the findings.
