# /strategy:go

The entry point. Understand what Julian needs, route to the right mode.

## Process

### Step 1: Understand the Input

Julian might provide:
- A full brief with brand, audience, problem, and context
- A sentence or question
- A link or pasted document
- A request to iterate on previous work
- A vague "help me think through X"

Read whatever Julian provides. Don't ask unnecessary questions.

### Step 2: Detect the Mode

| If the input suggests... | Route to... |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Brand positioning, repositioning, narrative strategy | `/strategy:narrative` |
| Creative brief for a campaign or activation | `/strategy:brief` |
| Product spec, product vision, service design | `/strategy:product` |
| "What's wrong with this," "poke holes," critique | `/strategy:pressure-test` |
| "Debate this," "stress test," multi-perspective | `/strategy:courtroom` |
| "Tighten this," "make it shorter," "cut slides," compress | `/strategy:distill` |
| "Research this," "find evidence," "verify claim," "back this up," "find examples" | `/strategy:research` |
| "What does the research tell us," "find the way in," "distill the research" | `/strategy:insight-distill` |
| "Is this ready for my boss," "review the narrative," "check against the brief" | `/strategy:narrative-review` |
| "Improve this skill," "autoresearch" | `/strategy:sharpen` |

### Step 3: Confirm and Route

If the mode is obvious, state it and proceed:
> "This reads like a brand positioning brief. I'll run it through narrative mode with the Brand DNA vs Cultural Truth engine. Here's the architecture..."

If the mode is ambiguous, propose 2 options with rationale and let Julian pick:
> "I could approach this two ways:
> 1. **Narrative mode** — full strategy doc with cultural grounding, coined concept, slide-ready copy
> 2. **Brief mode** — tight creative brief with a single proposition and mandatories
> Which fits what you need?"

### Step 4: Handoff

Once the mode is confirmed, invoke that mode's skill with Julian's full input carried forward. Don't make Julian repeat context.

## Cross-Mode Transitions

If Julian wants to chain modes (e.g., "now turn this positioning into a brief"), carry forward:
- The brief summary
- The approved concept
- Any feedback Julian gave during the current session
- The quality scores from the previous mode's output

Propose the transition. Don't auto-chain.
